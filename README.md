<h1><u>Analyzing Online Retail Sales</u></h1>


<h3>The goal of this project is to analyze and understand customer purchasing behavior, identify popular product categories, and uncover sales trends in an online retail store. It covers several phases of data analysis.</h3>

1. <b>The data preparation stage.</b>

    - This is the first stage of my data analysis project. At this stage, I downloaded my <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vijayuv/onlineretail">dataset</a> from kaggle and imported it into Mysql for cleaning and analysis.

2. <b>The data cleaning and manipulation stage.</b>

    - This is the second stage of my data analysis project. At this stage, I removed duplicates, identified and corrected inaccuracies, Null and empty cells, inconsistencies, and errors in my dataset to improve its quality and reliability.

3. <b> Data Transformation and Feature Engineering </b>

    - At this stage, I transformed the raw data into a more usable format for analysis and created new columns that can provide insights into customer behavior.
