<h1><u>Analyzing Online Retail Sales Data</u></h1>


<h3> In this project, I analyzed a dataset of online retail sales. This project covers several phases of data analysis. </h3>

1. <b>The data preparation stage.</b>

    - This is the first stage of my data analysis project. At this stage, I created a database, with four tables and inserted the sample data.

2. <b>The data cleaning and manipulation stage.</b>

    - This is the second stage of my data analysis project. At this stage, I removed duplicates, identified and corrected inaccuracies, inconsistencies, and errors in my dataset to improve its quality and reliability.
